# Machine-Learning-NLP-Spam-Detector
Challenge
In this challenge, we will use Natural Language Processing and Naive Bayes Classifier to detect spam. We will compare Naive Bayes with Logistic Regression to understand which is better for spam detection.

Concepts
Try out Naive Bayes Classifier on another dataset and analyze the outcome
Compare Naive Bayes against LogisticRegression
