# Machine-Learning-NLP-Spam-Detector
In this challenge, we will use Natural Language Processing and Naive Bayes Classifier to detect spam. We will compare Naive Bayes with Logistic Regression to understand which is better for spam detection.

Concepts for this challenge is to try out Naive Bayes Classifier, Logistic Regression and analyze the outcome
